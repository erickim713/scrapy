# Scrapy for RocketPunch Internship 

Fun mini-sized summer activity:

Download all packages involved in making this:

> cd ~/path_to_scrapy

move to the directory:

> pip install -r requirements.txt


Before executing the script, you have to **ERASE** the content of *first.json* and *second.json* [I should do somethingn about this later]

> ./crawler.sh

The result should give:

 - ***first.json***: company name, company description, url to further info
 - ***second.json***: job available at a company, company information, url to the page the information was gathered from

Lastly, ***readfile.py*** will produce output that's easy to read for the user.
